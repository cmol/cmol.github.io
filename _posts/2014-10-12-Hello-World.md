So now I have a tech blog. Home to thoughts, frustrations, fun, and hopefully some knowledge too at some point.

Chances are that this place will be a bit empty until I suceed in transfering my new domain, cmol.me, to here, but I already have lots of small things to write about.

Until then, have fun with this picture of what I'm working on at the moment :-)
