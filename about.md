Stud. Polyt.(C. Networktechnology and IT) @ Technical University of Denmark

### More Information

Most of my hours are used studying Networktechnology and IT, but I have a thing for making small weird projects that tend to grow in size.
One day I got a breadboard and som LEDs and now I have 5m of RGB-LED-strips setup in my small dorm room.. I'd be suprised if it's the last weird project I'll do.
